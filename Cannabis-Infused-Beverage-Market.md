Changes in government policy or legal roadblocks could slow market expansion or create logistical hurdles for producers.</li> <li><strong>Consumer Education:</strong> Many consumers still lack understanding of how cannabis-infused beverages affect the body. Increased efforts to educate the public on dosing, effects, and benefits will be necessary for broader adoption.</li> <li><strong>Price Point:</strong> Cannabis-infused beverages often come with a higher price tag compared to traditional non-alcoholic drinks, which could limit their reach to price-sensitive consumers.</li></ul><p>However, the opportunities presented by an expanding legal market, evolving consumer preferences, and new innovations in product offerings will likely overcome these challenges in the long run.</p><p>The cannabis-infused beverage market is poised for significant growth, from 2023 to 2033.
